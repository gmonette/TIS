abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between psychiatric disorders and socioeconomic status such as education, income, employment and area of community settings in Zhejiang province. METHODS: Data were from the epidemiological survey of mental illnesses aged 15 and older in 2001 (n = 14 632). Psychiatric disorders were measured by GHQ-12 with a cut-point 4. Logistic multilevel analysis was the main statistical method being used. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 18.5{\%}(95{\%} confidence intervals, 17.9{\%} to 19.1{\%}), higher than the data from Hebei province (u = 4.39, P {\textless} 0.001). Annual household income and employment were strongly associated with psychiatric disorders especially for those with low income (odds ratio 3.45, 95{\%}CI: 1.72 - 6.67) and unemployment (odds ratio 2.03, 95{\%}CI: 1.73 - 2.40). Factors as regional effect and education level showed weak or inconsistent association with psychiatric disorders after controlling on other indicators. CONCLUSION: Inverse gradient relation between psychiatric disorders and SES seemed as the main result of low SES individual characteristics and some minor effects at the county level.},

abstract = {Introduction/Objectives: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussions, are common during youth hockey participation, in which persisting functional deficits can result. In 2009-10, over 500,000 Canadian youth between the ages of 5 to 17 years were registered to play hockey, leaving many youth athletes at risk for sustaining a mTBI. Despite growing public interest in sport-related mTBI, what remains to be explored is the influence of mTBI on strength performance in youth. It is possible that deficits in strength post mTBI may put youth hockey players at risk for decreased performance and re-injury upon returning to play. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of age, gender and mTBI on strength performance within youth hockey players. Methods: This study used a three-year prospective longitudinal research design. The participant group was made up of 178 unique male and female participants (ages 8 to 14 years). Nineteen of the 178 participants sustained a mTBI while enrolled in the study, where three participants sustained repeated mTBIs for a total of 23 concussive events. Baseline and post-mTBI data on leg maximal voluntary contraction, jump test and hand grip performance were collected. Results: Using a linear mixed-effects model, interaction and linear models reporting effects of age, gender and sustaining a mTBI on strength performance were explored. Data specific to the full participant sample, as well as the mTBI subset are reported. When accounting for severity of postconcussive symptoms, significant average effects were found for jump height (squat jump: Estimate=-0.05; SE=0.02; t=-2.51; P=0.0186; countermovement jump: Estimate=-0.03; SE=0.02; t=-2.20; P=0.0371) during the symptomatic stage post-mTBI and for leg maximal voluntary contraction (Estimate=-1.05; SE=0.47; t=-2.27; P=0.0421) during the asymptomatic stage post-mTBI, indicating decreased strength performance following mTBI. Conclusions: This study acts as an initial step towards better understanding mTBI-related strength performance deficits that may limit the on and off ice occupational performance of the youth hockey player population and in turn, can act as a foundation for future youth, adolescent and adult sportrelated mTBI research and rehabilitation protocols.},

We conduct a simulation study to determine the effect various factors have on the estimation method. The factors we included in this study are scaling method, size of clusters, invariance of selection, informativeness of selection, intraclass correlation, and variability of standardized weights. The scaling method is an indicator of how the weights are normalized on each level. The invariance of the selection is an indicator of whether or not the same selection mechanism is applied across clusters. The informativeness of the selection is an indicator of how biased the selection is. We summarize our findings and recommend a multi-stage procedure based on the MPML method that can be used in practical applications.},

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Birnbaum (1962a) argued that the conditionality principle (C) and the sufficiency principle (S) implied the likelihood principle (L); he then argued (Birnbaum 1972) that C and a mathematical equivalence principle M implied L. Evans, Fraser, and Monette (1985a) gave reference details, and this paper gives proof that C alone implies L. The level of support by the profession for L is sharply less than that for S or even for C; thus the paradoxical nature of these results. In this regard, we elaborate on the Monette example (Fraser, Monette, and Ng 1984), which provides a strong case against L. We also examine closely the various proofs linking the principles and find that S and C can each be used operationally to suppress information otherwise deemed relevant. From another viewpoint this says that S and C can each be used in contexts that directly conflict with the original examples and motivations supporting them; the principles can thus be viewed as inappropriately used, or more strongly, as invalid. In either case, the result that C and S imply L or that C implies L can be regarded as noneffective in the context of discriminating applications. A resolution of the apparent anomalies can be obtained by allowing the statistical model to include ingredients additional to those usually present (particularly for subsequent use with conditionality), or alternatively by restricting the application of the principles to contexts where the conflicts would seem not to arise.},

abstract = {Estimation of premorbid IQ in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is clinically and scientifically valuable because it permits the quantification of the cognitive impact of injury. This is achieved by comparing performances on tests of current ability to estimates of premorbid IQ, thereby enabling current capacity to be interpreted in light of preinjury ability. However, the validity of premorbid IQ tests that are commonly used for TBI has been questioned. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of a recently developed test, the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), which has yet to be examined for TBI. The cognitive performance of a group of 24 patients recovering from TBI (with a mean Glasgow Coma Scale score in the severely impaired range) was measured at 2 and 5 months postinjury. On both occasions, patients were administered three tests that have been used to measure premorbid IQ (the WTAR and the Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd Edition, WAIS-III) and three tests of current ability (Symbol Digit Modalities Test-Oral and Similarities and Block Design subtests of the WAIS-III). We found that performance significantly improved on tests of current cognitive ability, confirming recovery. In contrast, stable performance was observed on the WTAR from Assessment 1 (M = 34.25/50) to Assessment 2 (M = 34.21/50; r = .970, p {\textless} .001). Mean improvement across assessments was negligible (t = -0.086, p = .47; Cohen's d = -.005), and minimal individual participant change was observed (modal scaled score change = 0). WTAR scores were also highly similar to scores on a demographic estimate of premorbid IQ. Thus, converging evidence--high stability during recovery from TBI and similar IQ estimates to those of a demographic equation suggests that the WTAR is a valid measure of premorbid IQ for TBI. Where word pronunciation tests are indicated (i.e., in patients for whom English is spoken and read fluently), these results endorse the use of the WTAR for patients with TBI.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

abstract = {The Akzo Nobel research laboratories formulated this problem in their study of the penetration of radio-labeled antibodies into a tissue that has been infected by a tumor. This study was carried out for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. The treatment of malignant diseases, after its primary treatment by surgery, is either by external beam radiotherapy, which is effective but local, or by chemotherapy, which is effective but not selective. The radiotherapy labelled antibody has to be able to penetrate the whole of the tumour, whereas for imaging only uptake on the surface of the tumour is needed. Factors such as dose, rate delivered, tumor size, and radiosensitivity play a major role in determining therapeutic response, while target-to-nontarget ratios and, particularly, circulating radioactivity to the bone marrow determine the major dose-limiting toxicities. In this article, we introduced a system of differential equations with small parameter with applications in radioimmunotherapy. The problem consists of two partial differential equations. Both the equation of this system includes small parameter epsilon. We introduce the mathematical technique known as boundary function method for singular perturbation system. In this system, the small parameter is an asymptotic variable, different from the independent variable. We write solution of this system in a small parameter, and investigation of asymptotic solution for system. Using the program Matlab and numerical method Runge-Kutta, I did various simulations for different values of biological parameters presented in the model studied.},

Five of these journals explicitly require reporting ES and the other 5 have no such policy. Data were obtained from 99 articles published in the years 2003 and 2004, in which 183 statistical analyses were conducted. Findings indicate no major differences between the two types of journals in terms of ES reporting practices. Different conclusions could be reached based on interpreting ES versus p values. The discrepancy between conclusions based on statistical versus practical significance is frequently not reported, not interpreted, and mostly not discussed or resolved. 10.1177/0013164408315266},

abstract = {RGL is a library of functions that offers three-dimensional, real-time visu- alization functionality to the R programming environment. It ameliorates a shortcoming in the current version of R (and most other statistical software packages), namely the inability to allow the user to conveniently generate interactive 3D graphics. Since 3D objects need to be projected on a 2D display, special navigation capabilities are needed to provide insight into 3D relationships. Features such as lighting, alpha blending, texture mapping and fog effects are used to en- hance the illusion of three-dimensionality. Additional desirable features for interactive data analysis in 3D are the ability to rotate objects, and to zoom in/out so as to examine details of an object, or alternatively, to view it from a distance. The goal of the project described here was to provide a “3D engine” with an API (Application Programming Interface) designed for R. It is implemented as a portable shared library (written in C++) that uses OpenGL. The syntax of the RGL commands has been based on that of the related and familiar standard R commands, thus ensuring that users familiar with the latter can quickly learn the usage of RGL. This paper outlines the capabilities of the of the RGL library and illustrates them using some typical statistical applications.},

The "lasso" minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

abstract = {Green RE, Colella B, Hebert DA, Bayley M, Kang HS, Till C, Monette G. Prediction of return to productivity after severe traumatic brain injury: investigations of optimal neuropsychological tests and timing of assessment. Objectives: (1) To examine predictive validity of global neuropsychological performance, and performance on timed tests (controlling for manual motor function) and untimed tests, including attention, memory, executive function, on return to productivity at 1 year after traumatic brain injury (TBI). (2) To compare predictive validity at 8 weeks versus 5 months postinjury. (3) To examine predictive validity of early degree of recovery (8wk-5mo postinjury) for return to productivity. Design: Longitudinal, within subjects. Setting: Inpatient neurorehabilitation and community. Participants: Patients (N=63) with moderate to severe TBI. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome: return to productivity at 1 year postinjury. Primary predictors: neuropsychological composite scores. Control variables: posttraumatic amnesia, acute care length of stay (LOS), Glasgow Coma Scale score, age, and estimated premorbid intelligence quotient. Results: Return to productivity was significantly correlated with global neuropsychological performance at 5 months postinjury (P{\textless}.05) and showed a trend toward significance at 8 weeks. Performance on the untimed composite score, and more specifically executive and memory functions, mirrored this pattern. Logical Memory performance significantly predicted return to productivity, but not other memory tests. Timed tests showed no significance or trend at either time point. Early degree of recovery did not predict return to productivity. Among control variables, only acute care LOS was predictive of return to productivity. Conclusions: Findings validate utility of early neuropsychological assessment for predicting later return to productivity. They also provide more precise information regarding the optimal timing and test type: results support testing at 5 months postinjury on untimed tests (memory and executive function), but not simple attention or speed of mental processing. Findings are discussed with reference to previous literature. ?? 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {Genetic markers can be used as instrumental variables, in an analogous way to randomization in a clinical trial, to estimate the causal relationship between a phenotype and an outcome variable. Our purpose is to extend the existing methods for such Mendelian randomization studies to the context of multiple genetic markers measured in multiple studies, based on the analysis of individual participant data. First, for a single genetic marker in one study, we show that the usual ratio of coefficients approach can be reformulated as a regression with heterogeneous error in the explanatory variable. This can be implemented using a Bayesian approach, which is next extended to include multiple genetic markers. We then propose a hierarchical model for undertaking a meta-analysis of multiple studies, in which it is not necessary that the same genetic markers are measured in each study. This provides an overall estimate of the causal relationship between the phenotype and the outcome, and an assessment of its heterogeneity across studies. As an example, we estimate the causal relationship of blood concentrations of C-reactive protein on fibrinogen levels using data from 11 studies. These methods provide a flexible framework for efficient estimation of causal relationships derived from multiple studies. Issues discussed include weak instrument bias, analysis of binary outcome data such as disease risk, missing genetic data, and the use of haplotypes.},

A database containing 319 TBI patients (aged 7–88 yrs) with a broad spectrum of coma duration was used. Statistical analysis of mixed effects modelling was applied to longitudinal Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised scores to construct 2 mathematical models (verbal IQ and performance IQ). The models predict the course of recovery (initial cognitive level post-coma, eventual recovery level, and level of cognitive functioning at any point on the recovery curve) when the duration of coma is known. Performance IQ was found to recover at a rate that is almost four times slower than verbal IQ. The results have important clinical rehabilitation implications. This statistical modelling technique also enables the medical researcher to investigate disease progression or recovery using structured assessments, which would normally be part of the routine medical monitoring.

abstract = {Three-dimensional dynamic scatterplots can reveal certain features of data that cannot be apprehended in marginal two-dimensional displays. Using graduate students as subjects, we sought to establish whether the detection of clusters and nonlinearity in 3-D plots varies by easily characterized properties of the data and the design of the display. We found that the probability of detection of clusters increased smoothly with cluster separation, and that, at a fixed level of separation, "diagonally" displaced clusters were easier to detect than "horizontally" displaced clusters. Cluster detection appeared to be affected to a smaller extent by the design of the display. Three further experiments addressed the detection of nonlinearity in 3-D dynamic scatterplots. Most subjects were able to respond in a reasonable manner to properties of the data, so that the probability of detection of nonlinearity increased with its level, particularly when the signal was strong. As in the experiment on cluster detection, subjects' performance was also affected, though to a lesser extent, by characteristics of the displays; for example, spinning the display horizontally in the regression plane was particularly effective. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of statistical software incorporating dynamic 3-D scatterplots.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concussion is the most common athletic injury in youth who are simultaneously undergoing rapid developmental changes in the brain, specifically the development of executive functions (EF). The developing brain is more vulnerable to concussive injury with a protracted and different trajectory of recovery than that of adults. Thus, there is a critical need to enhance understanding of how concussion affects EF in youth.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of age, gender and concussion history (i.e. concussion incidence, recency, severity) on EF in youth hockey players.

METHODS: This 3-year cross-sectional and longitudinal multiple cohort study examined data from 211 hockey players of 8-15 years of age. Mixed-effects modelling was used to examine the influence of age, gender and concussion on EF in youth athletes.

FINDINGS: Baseline analyses revealed significant age and gender effects on measures of EF. Multiple effects of concussion history on measures of cognitive flexibility (F = 2.48, p = 0.03) and psychomotor speed (F = 2.59, p = 0.04) were found.

IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the impact of age, gender and concussion on EF in youth. These findings provide foundational knowledge to better manage cognitive sequelae following sports-related concussion.},

Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

Objectives: To examine the influence of cognitive reserve-related moderator variables on recovery trajectories during the first year after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using mixed effects models, we measured (1) the level of cognitive function at 2 and 12 months postinjury and (2) the trajectories of cognitive recovery during the first 12 months postinjury. Design: Repeated-measures design with neuropsychological testing at 2, 5, and 12 months postinjury. Setting: Large, urban inpatient neurorehabilitation program. Participants: Patients (N=75) with moderate-to-severe TBI. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes: neuropsychological composite scores including simple speed of processing, complex speed of processing, memory, untimed executive functions, and attention span. Primary predictors: age, estimated premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), and years of education. Results: Only age significantly moderated trajectories. Decreasing age significantly enhanced recovery of speed of processing, both simple (2-12mo postinjury, P{\textless}.001) and complex (2-12mo postinjury, P{\textless}.05; 5-12mo postinjury, P{\textless}.005). Decreasing age and increasing estimated premorbid IQ were associated with higher performance at 2 and 12mo postinjury for simple speed of processing (premorbid IQ, 2 and 12mo), complex speed of processing (age, 2 and 12mo), untimed executive functions (premorbid IQ, 2 and 12mo), and memory (premorbid IQ, 2 and 12mo). Conclusions: Recovery of speed of processing (both simple and complex) was favorably moderated by younger age. Older age is associated with more neuronal loss and less integrity of white matter, and speed of processing is associated with white matter networks. The recuperative effects of younger age may therefore be attributable to greater reserve capacity (as indexed by white matter integrity). Lower age and higher estimated premorbid IQ were associated with higher functioning on a variety of cognitive outcomes. This may reflect the buffering effects of reserve capacity or premorbid differences in age and IQ-related cognitive functioning. Implications for rehabilitation and recovery mechanisms are discussed. ?? 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

Recovery of cognitive function after traumatic brain injury: a multilevel modeling analysis of Canadian outcomes. Objective: To ascertain patterns of cognitive recovery during the first year after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Specifically, differential recovery across cognitive domains was investigated. Design: Prospective, longitudinal, naturalistic, 1-year follow-up study. Setting: Large, urban inpatient neurorehabilitation program. Participants: Patients (N=75) with moderate to severe TBI. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Patients with TBI were followed over the course of 1 year, during which participants' neuropsychological status was repeatedly evaluated at 3 time points (2, 5, and 12 months postinjury). Results: Multilevel modeling results were consistent with previous research, demonstrating that recovery in the first year postinjury is asymptotic in nature, with more accelerated recovery occurring during the first 5 to 6 months. Importantly, results also suggest that recovery is not uniform across cognitive domains. From 2 to 5 months postinjury, steeper recovery curves were revealed for indices of memory, speeded executive function, verbal abstraction, and manual dexterity relative to untimed tests of executive function and word knowledge. Recovery trajectories did not significantly vary as a function of cognitive domain over the course of the last 5 to 12 months. Conclusions: These results are the first to explore trajectories of recovery directly as a function of multiple cognitive domains. They are expected to have implications for rehabilitative efforts as well as our understanding of the architecture of natural recovery after TBI. ?? 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

Statistical analysis of mixed effects modelling was applied to longitudinal WAIS-R (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised) scores to construct two mathematical models (verbal IQ and performance IQ). The models predict the course of recovery (initial cognitive level post-coma, eventual recovery level, and level of cognitive functioning at any point on the recovery curve) when the duration of coma is known. Performance IQ was found to recover at a rate that is almost four times slower than verbal IQ. The results have important clinical rehabilitation implications.

abstract = {The precarious state of the educational system in the inner cities of the United States, as well as its potential causes and solutions, have been popular topics of debate in recent years. Part of the dif? culty in resolving this debate is the lack of solid empirical evidence regarding the true impact of educational initiatives. The ef? cacy of so-called “school choice” programs has been a particularly contentious issue.A current multimillion dollar program, the School Choice Scholarship Foundation Program in New York, randomized the distribution of vouchers in an attempt to shed some light on this issue. This is an important time for school choice, because on June 27, 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a voucher program in Cleveland that provides scholarships both to secular and religious private schools. Although this study bene? ts immensely from a randomized design, it suffers from complications common to such research with human subjects: noncompliance with assigned “treatments” and missing data. Recent work has revealed threats to valid estimates of experimental effects that exist in the presence of noncompliance and missing data, even when the goal is to estimate simple intention-to-treat effects. Our goal was to create a better solution when faced with both noncompliance and missing data. This article presents a model that accommodates these complications that is based on the general framework of “principal strati? cation” and thus relies on more plausible assumptions than standard methodology. Our analyses revealed positive effects on math scores for children who applied to the program from certain types of schools—those with average test scores below the citywide median. Among these children, the effects are stronger for children who applied in the first grade and for African-American children.},

And yet, when you looked at a breakdown of the different subjects people could apply for, it showed that women were not losing out disproportionately to men. How could two opposite findings be true?

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

They conclude that all three simply reiterate the occurrence of a change in the association of any two variables when a third variable is statistically controlled for. This is not surprising because reversal or change in magnitude is common in conditional analysis. At the heart of the phenomenon of change in magnitude, with or without reversal of effect estimate, is the question of which to use: the unadjusted (combined table) or adjusted (sub-table) estimate. Hence, Simpson's paradox and related phenomena are a problem of covariate selection and adjustment (when to adjust or not) in the causal analysis of non-experimental data. It cannot be overemphasized that although these paradoxes reveal the perils of using statistical criteria to guide causal analysis, they hold neither the explanations of the phenomenon they depict nor the pointers on how to avoid them. The explanations and solutions lie in causal reasoning which relies on background knowledge, not statistical criteria.},

abstract = {The relation between probability and statistics in a curriculum is influenced by the cultural context (Holmes 1994). The conceptual difficulties with learning probability are sometimes used to recommend a curriculum emphasizing statistics with minimal probability (Garfield and Ahlgren 1988). On the other hand, statistical data analysis imports many more foreign elements into a mathematics curriculum than probability does, which may be a reason to recommend a concentration on probability. With regard to general education, most people agree that - if we teach probability - we should teach applied probability, i.e. emphasizing how probability can be used to model and understand some part of the real world. Therefore, questions concerning the meaning of probability are very important. How are probability models related to deterministic models and to thinking in terms of causal relations? However, to which extent will the idea of a statistics curriculum with minimal probability be reasonable? Tendencies in statistics towards relativizing the role of probability seem to reinforce this inclination in favor of a minimum curriculum. However, there are indications that this may contribute to new learning difficulties, and we will raise the following basic questions to which the paper will provide some first answers and reflections: (1) To what extent are learning difficulties with probability influenced/caused by a too simple (pure, objectivistic) educational conception of probability? (2) To what extent are novices' difficulties with a successful use of data analysis methods influenced/caused by a too simple (probability-free) educational conception of data analysis?},

abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 10.2 (2004) 141-177 Historians do not usually like to speak of the "lessons of history," as if [it] were some objective, finally definitive schoolteacher. But in many years of work at the craft, I have never come across a story that so directly yields a moral. The moral is that the presence or absence of a strong feminist movement makes the difference between better or worse solutions to the social problem of child sexual abuse. . . . Without a feminist analysis, evidence of child sexual abuse means that danger lies in sex perverts, in public spaces, in unsupervised girls, in sexually assertive girls. . . . As with adult rape, child sexual abuse without feminist interpretation supplies evidence and arguments for constricting and disempowering children. —Linda Gordon, "The Politics of Child Sexual Abuse" In the 1970s the child protection lobby and feminism together spearheaded a painstaking interrogation and politicization of the social problem of child sexual abuse. By the 1980s a powerful discourse of child sexual abuse was working hard to expose the widespread problem of incest in the patriarchal family and was vigorously contesting legal definitions of abuse that ignored or downplayed nonpenetrative sexual acts. The myth of stranger danger was found to be a patriarchal ruse as feminists produced an array of statistics revealing that fathers, other male relatives, and male acquaintances were the primary perpetrators of child sexual assault. Drawing on the rhetoric of radical feminist antirape and antipornography movements, a new approach to abuse emerged that expanded the definitional terrain of sexual abuse as well as eroded distinctions among the acts it comprised. Feminists were particularly influential in challenging the notion that children subjected to sexual abuse were somehow complicit in the crime (by seducing adults, "asking for it," or fabricating charges) or that child prostitutes and children involved in pornography or intergenerational sex could knowingly consent to such activities. In a significant reversal of the common twentieth-century tendency of victim blaming, the innocent, powerless, blameless, and unconsenting "victim" and "survivor" of sexual abuse became key cultural terms. The "rediscovery" of child sexual abuse—perhaps more accurately called a "reinterpretation"—has been profoundly important for Western culture. Few would dispute that patriarchal social structures, male sexuality, and power relations between the sexes and between adults and children have been subjected to much-needed critical scrutiny or that our reexamination of the dynamics of child sexual abuse and its detrimental effects has generated valuable insights into diagnosis, therapeutic intervention (for both offenders and victims), and management. However, significant gains are often accompanied by equally significant losses. This essay suggests that, despite admirable efforts to empower children and protect them from the harmful consequences of sexual abuse, they have in one particularly notable way been disempowered and disarmed by the child sexual abuse movement. I argue that the discourse of child sexual abuse has expanded at the expense of a discourse of child sexuality. Rigorous attempts to expose the reality and dynamics of child sexual abuse have been aided, if not in part made possible, by equally rigorous attempts to conceal, repress, or ignore the reality and dynamics of child sexuality. This placing of child sexuality under erasure has had deleterious consequences at both the level of everyday practice and at the level of theory. First, the desexualization of childhood has damaging psychological and psychotherapeutic consequences for child victims of sexual abuse. Second, with "child sexuality" figured only as an oxymoron in the feminist discourse of child sexual abuse, its erasure ensures that the categories of "child" and "adult" are kept distinct and at a safe epistemological distance. For queer theorists trained to unpack the mutual imbrication and constitution of binary oppositions, this is highly problematic. As will be shown, not only does queer theory have much to offer theorizations of the relationship between analytic axes of "sexuality" and "age," but there may be an instructive methodological lesson for queer theory to glean from failed feminist attempts to hierarchize sexuality by way of a linear and sequential logic of age stratification.

The purpose of the current study is to test for gender differences in the short-term mental health effects of a marital status transition using three waves of data collected at two year intervals in a Canadian population health survey (N=11,155). Growth curve analyses confirm the mental health advantage of marriage and reveal that the short-term effects of moving into and out of marriage on psychological distress are similar for men and women.

It is shown, by simulation, that simple models with dummy variables outperform both random effect models and models ignoring the hierarchy in terms of balance of cluster-level unobserved covariates and omitted variable bias. The representation of the clusters by fixed or random effects defines a model more general than would be ideal if the relevant cluster-level variables were available. The general conclusion confirms that when conducting propensity score analysis it is safer to specify a more general model than pursuing model parsimony. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10{\%} of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},
