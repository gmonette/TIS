#' # Introduction
#' 
#' We think of data as the bedrock of factual truth. 
#' 
#' Yet exactly the same data, analyzed in slightly different 
#' ways can lead to opposite conclusions.
#' 
#' This is the root of one of the most famous aphorisms about
#' statistics: There are lies, damned lies and ... statistics. 
#' attributed to Benjamin Disraeli. Some believe, and maybe some research would confirm, that Disraeli said this in the context of political debates about the "Corn Laws" in the mid 1800s -- that era's version of a free trade pact. Different analyses led to difference conclusion.  Disraeli was a protectionist.

#' # Short description
#' 
#' The theme of this course is inspired by a statement H. G. Wells made in 1937 
#' "A certain elementary training in statistical 
#' method is becoming as necessary for anyone living in this world of today as 
#' reading and writing."  What important issue Which statistical concepts are vital for informed
#' citizenship? 
#' 
#' The course will start with a review of of 
#' probability and statistics.
#' We then explore major modern issues and controversies that have
#' statistical roots: the 'crisis' of reproducibility, fallacies in
#' inference that lead to wrongful murder convictions, the statistical
#' mistunderstanding behing the crash of 2008, determining the causes
#' of climate change, etc. 
#' 
#' The statistical concepts behind these questions can be expressed using
#' mathematics at a level well within the grasp of high school students.   
#' 
#' 
#' the common
#' misinterpretation of  
#' 
#' roots. The statistical concepts are within the 
#' 
#' we will need are well within the
#' grasp of   
#' statistical ideas.  We will consider how issues like what is termed 
#' the crisis of non-reproducibility, the 
#' non-#'
#' # Agresti and Liu-Meng diagrams: Capital Punishment in Florida
#'    
#'    Show Florida capital punishement.
#'    
#'    Show Berkeley admissions data. Raise question: which is the best. 
#'    Should we use marginal or conditional. It depends on whether, 
#'    in the process of discrimination, department are counfounders 
#'    or mediators.  If the discrimination comes from the 
#'    Board of Regents underfunding disciplines favoured by women, 
#'    then the departments is a mediating variable. 
#'    If discrimination occurs at the department level, 
#'    then department is a confounder -- but not really a **common cause**! 
#' 
#' __So I have to refine my concept of confounding to include more 
#' than common causes but somehow avoid extending it to mediators.__
#' 
#' Why is this approach not used more widely.  Because we feel that our
#' contribution should be one of helping people converge towards 
#' a deterministic view of the world -- when most of the time 
#' the deeper reality is that knowledge expands through better questions.
#' 
#' The best answer is, usually, better questions. The Berkeley 
#' example is, I think, a good one.
#' 
#' Review the Iran Journal of Cancer Prevention thing on deterministic thinking.

## Meanderings -------
#'
#' 1.  Hypothesis testing is a model that is conflated with reality.
#' 2.  Almost all models are simplifications of the reality they
#'     represent. Models that work well for some purposes turn out
#'     to oversimplify for others.
#' 3.  Barnard's statement (how much I wish I could speak to him
#'     today) that "Neyman's contribution to statistics had been
#'     great, but its influence so much greater than it should have
#'     been that statistics would have been better off if Barnard
#'     had never lived," makes so much more sense to me now than
#'     it did when I heard in 1981. (August 4, 1981 and Neyman died
#'     on August 4, 1981, pwp)
#' 4.  Connections with Jon Stewart and Crossfire: His objection to
#'     the dichotomization of debate.
#' 5.  The best answer is usually a better question.
#' 6.  H. G. Wells in 1937:  "A certain elementary 
#'     training in statistical method is becoming as 
#'     necessary for anyone living in this world of 
#'     today as reading and writing.
#' 7.  Involves ideas that are not part of the standard academic
#'     statistical curriculum that focuses on the mathematical theory
#'     and methodology of statistics.  What's needed is 
#'     'statistical thinking' whose understanding require little
#'     more than understanding the deeper significance of 2 x 2
#'     tables.      
#' 8.  We have lost sight of simple basic ideas that are more 
#'     important in practice than ...

#'     Base rate neglect. Bayesian thinking. A visual guide to 
#'     Bayesian thinking. Is this the basis of discrimination?
#'     Principle: '''remember your priors'''. Fallacy of 
#'     confirmation: If P(A|B) is high, and A is true is that
#'     evidence for B?  Not nearly as much as actually getting
#'     P(B|A) that requires...

#' 14. How Bayes should change the way you think.
#' 15. The pursuit of the mathematical theory of uncertainty
#'     and its enshrinement in academia -- its promise that truth
#'     can be found by applying its seemingly magical formulas --
#'     has obscured a fundamental understanding of inference 
#'     that is base on no more than a careful attention to 2 x 2
#'     tables.
